# Simple Menu System

This project houses a simple menu system created with C++ and Raylib.

The idea behind this is to allow simple, yet powerful creation of a set of menus and options all from code.

You can quickly create a menu, fill it with options and position them correctly via the passed in params.

Menus itself is built to be used like a stack, with only the top menu being actively updated. This should
allow multiple menus to exist on screen without getting in the way of one another, but also allowing a programmer
to configure multiple menus on one screen via game state.

NOTE: This is still a work in progress
